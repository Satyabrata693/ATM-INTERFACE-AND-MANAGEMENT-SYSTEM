# ATM-INTERFACE-AND-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
## Problem Statement
The proposed ATM system has a drastic change to that of the older version of banking system, customer feel inconvenient with the transaction method as it was in the hands of the bank employees. In our ATM system, the above problem is overcome here, the transactions are done in person by the customer thus makes the customers feel safe and secure. Thus the application of our system helps the customer in creating the account, checking the balance and transaction of the amount by validating the pin number and also can log out the user therefore our ATM system is more user friendly.
## PURPOSE
In Java, we created an ATM program for representing ATM transactions. In the ATM program, the user has to select an option from the options displayed on the screen. The options are related to account sign-up or login or reset pin, withdraw the money, deposit the money, check the balance, and logout.

1.	The java Program can Display the ATM Transaction.
2.	The user can create multiple accounts for sign-up and login.
3.	The user can also reset the pin.
4.	The user can deposit money from this ATM Machine project.
5.	The user can withdraw cash from this ATM Machine project.
6.	The user can check the bank account balance.
7.	Then the user can also log out his/her account.

- The user can simply sign-up or login or reset pin, his/her account by choosing the options.

- ATM users can deposit money to the bank by choosing the deposit option. The java program will simply get the deposit amount from the user and add the money to the user's account.

- Users can withdraw money from their bank account through the program by selecting the withdrawal option. After a successful transaction, the ATM machine will deduct the amount from the central bank account.

- The user can also check their existing bank account total balance using the checking account balance option. 

- Finally, the logout option will simply logout the users from the ATM machine program and return the user to the default main menu.
